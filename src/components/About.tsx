      <p className="mb-4">
        Japanolearn is a Japanese learning platform created to help users learn
        Japanese through lessons, exercises, a dictionary, and AI-powered
        assistance. The platform was designed with the aim of providing
        accessible and affordable education, particularly for people in
        developing countries where hiring a teacher may be difficult or too
        costly. With Japanolearn, learners can access high-quality language
        education from anywhere, helping bridge the gap in learning resources.
